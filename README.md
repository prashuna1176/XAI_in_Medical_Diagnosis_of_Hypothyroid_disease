# XAI_in_Medical_Diagnosis_of_Hypothyroid_disease

This project applies **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** techniques to the diagnosis of **Hypothyroid Disease** using clinical data. The goal is to not only build a predictive model but also provide **transparency and interpretability** in the decision-making process to support trust and understanding in medical AI systems.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** [Hypothyroid Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nguyenthilua/hypothyroidcsv)
- The dataset contains anonymized patient medical records used to identify hypothyroid conditions.

## üìÇ Files

- `XAI_in_diagnosis_in_hypothyroid.ipynb` ‚Äì Notebook implementing Explainable AI models (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to interpret predictions.
- `diagnosis.ipynb` ‚Äì Core diagnostic model using machine learning techniques.

## üß™ Objective

1. Predict whether a patient has hypothyroidism using structured clinical data.
2. Apply XAI techniques to interpret and explain the predictions made by the model.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Used

- **Machine Learning Models** (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests)
- **XAI Methods**: 
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
  - LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

## üß¨ Why XAI in Healthcare?

XAI methods allow clinicians and stakeholders to:

- Understand *why* a model makes a particular prediction.
- Detect bias or incorrect logic in black-box models.
- Increase trust and accountability in AI-powered medical tools.

## üìå How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nguyenthilua/hypothyroidcsv) and place it in your working directory.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks (`XAI_in_diagnosis_in_hypothyroid.ipynb` and `diagnosis.ipynb`) in sequence.
